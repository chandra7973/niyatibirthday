I wanted to express few things...<br>
I met you when i had no hopes and happiness left in my life..<br>
Nothing used to excite me back then, not even my favourite things..<br>
Since you entered idk what actually happened but, it felt like you turned my black n white life back to colored one<br>
May be some things are bound to happen but..this time..<br>
I feel like I can't leave this on my thread of fate..
